#0. PLOT THE DATA!!!

#1. Test/Check normality
	#QQ Plot
	#Shapiro Wilk Test
	#Histogram (Usually we don't do only this)


#2. Homogenetity of Varience 
	#Levene's Test
	#Note: Add Mauchlys test for sphericity if repeated measures design


#3. Run the Test
	#T-Test: means comparison between 2 groups 
	#ANOVA: means comparison between 3 or more groups
		#One way ANOVA: means comparison between 3 or more groups
		#Two way ANOVA: means comparison between 3 or more groups and interaction affects
		#Nested ANOVA: means comparison between 3 or more groups but we have to account for things in experimental design that cannot be controlled. Nesting affects/variables. 
			#Mother, herd, city - often a shared condition but not what we're looking at
		#Repeated measure ANOVA: means comparison between 3 or more groups and multiple measurements within each subject (often at different time points)
	#Linear Regression: relationship between 2 variables (positive or negative)
	#Chi-Square test: frequency between defined groups/characters etc. - often behavioral counts,  visitation, preference. Categorical data correlations.
